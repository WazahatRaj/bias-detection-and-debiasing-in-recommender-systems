# bias-detection-and-debiasing-in-recommender-systems
This project detects bias and evaluates fairness in recommender systems using causal inference and fairness metrics. We estimate the causal effect of user attributes (e.g., gender) on recommendations and use Fairlearn to measure fairness through metrics like demographic parity.
